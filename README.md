# Movie-Recommendation-and-Ratings

Objectives:
Predict the rating that a user would give to a movie that he has not yet rated.
Minimize the difference between predicted and actual rating (RMSE)

I implemented various models to predict the ratings some of which were SVD, linear regression + Ridge regression (by creating extra features) , and the hybrid model combinig all.
